# Temperature Sensors

## DHT11.py
This program will read the temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor. It will output the readings to the terminal and also store them in a xlsx file.

## BMP280.py
This program is nearly the same as **DHT11.py**, it will read the temperature, pressure, and humidity from a Pimironi BMP280 sensor. It will output the readings to the terminal and also store them in a xlsx file.
